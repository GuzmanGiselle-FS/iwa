            <strong> Prosthetic makeup </strong> known as
            <strong> special makeup effects or FX prosthesis,</strong>
            is the process of using prosthetic sculpting, molding and casting
            techniques to create advanced cosmetic effects. Prosthetics are used
            on stage and screen to create fantasy creatures, simulated injuries,
            or likenesses of other people.

            Before sculpted prosthetic appliances became standard, special
            effects makeup artists would have to build up forms on the actor's
            face before shooting began, which often took several hours and would
            have to be done from scratch at the start of each day. The
            Frankenstein makeup by Jack Pierce consisted of spirit gum, cotton,
            collodion, and wax, taking around 3 hours to apply in the morning,
            and another 1-2 hours to remove at the end of the day. [1] Rubber
            began to be used to make appliances in the late 30s, with Pierce
            making rubber head forms and broken neck appliances for Boris
            Karloff and Bela Lugosi respectively. A rubber snout was made for
            Lon Chaney Jr. to wear in The Wolfman, though application of the
            hair for the titular character could take up to 16 hours.[2] Foam
            latex was first used by makeup artist Jack Dawn for The Wizard of Oz
            in 1939 to create the makeup for the Cowardly Lion and
            Scarecrow.[3][4] It wasn't until John Chambers's work on Planet of
            the Apes in 1968 that prosthetics transitioned from full face
            appliances to smaller, overlapping pieces which afforded the actors
            more expression and movement.[5] In 1965, William Tuttle won an
            Academy Honorary Award for his makeup work on 7 Faces of Dr. Lao at
            the 37th Academy Awards, making him the first artist to win an award
            for makeup before the Best Makeup category was introduced in 1981.

            Moulage is a process in which makeup is used to simulate different
            wounds and trauma in order to prepare medical, emergency, and
            military personnel for what they could experience in the field and
            lessen psychological trauma.

          <h3>Crainiofacial Prosthetics</h3>
          <p>
            Craniofacial prosthetics are used in medical fields for cosmetic
            purposes to disguise deformations of the face, either those caused
            by trauma or birth defects as an alternative to reconstructive
            surgery. They can be used for smaller applications such as ears or
            noses, or full face masks. These prosthetics can provide both
            medical benefits such as improved speech and hearing as well as
            psychological benefits to the wearer.[9]

            The process of creating a makeup prosthetic appliance typically
            begins with concept art, created by the artist or production. Once
            the actor has been chosen, the effects artist will prepare the actor
            for the process of taking a mold of the actor's face, head or body
            part. This process is called lifecasting. Lifecast molds are made
            from prosthetic alginate or more recently, from skin-safe platinum
            silicone rubber. This initial mold can be relatively weak but
            flexible. A hard mother mold, also known as a jacket or matrix, is
            typically made of plaster bandage which is created over the outside
            of the initial flexible mold to provide support. This mold is used
            to cast a copy of that part of the actor, in a hard resin or plaster
            type material to eventually use as a base for sculpting the
            prosthetic. This is considered a "positive" or life-cast. Before
            sculpting the clay prosthetic over the positive, The positive must
            be prepared by adding "keys" or mold points along the edges of it,
            which are often added using clay or more plaster or carved into the
            life-cast, to make sure that the two pieces of the mold will fit
            together correctly. Often the life-cast will be given an additional
            border in clay or plaster in order to have an area free of detail
            and undercuts to add these keys. The entire life-cast with borders
            and keys included is then molded. This ensures a stable area with
            built in keys to sculpt the prosthetic over. This also provides the
            artist an easily duplicated copy, if needed. Multiple copies are
            typically used to make variations or stages of prosthetics or
            different prosthetics for the same actor. Life-casts of full bodies
            and body parts are also used and reused as the basis for making fake
            body parts, severed limbs, and various "gore" type effects used in
            horror films or films where body parts are required. The prosthetic
            required will be sculpted over the life-cast of that body part to
            become the design intended. For example, if the desired look is a
            pig nosed person, then the artist would sculpt the pig nose over the
            actor's real nose on the life-cast or positive copy. The edges of
            the clay should be made as thin as possible, for the clay is a
            stand-in for what will eventually be the prosthetic piece. Once
            sculpted, the new addition of the clay sculpted prosthetic part must
            be molded. Since the positive has been prepared with the additional
            border and keys, it actually becomes part of the prosthetic mold
            itself. Once molded, and clay removed, new mold cleaned out, the
            positive is one part of the mold and the new mold is the other side
            which has the negative of the newly sculpted prosthetic. This gives
            two or more pieces of a mold - a positive of the face or body part,
            and one (or more for complex molds) "negative" mold pieces with
            prosthetic sculpted in. To make the new prosthetic, material is cast
            into the mold cavity (where the clay used to be). The prosthetic
            material can be foam latex, gelatin, silicone or other similar
            materials. The prosthetic is cured within the two-part mold, and
            then carefully removed and prepared for painting and or application
            to the actor.
